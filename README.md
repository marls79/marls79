## My Personal Journey

Hi, I'm Marlene Davids 👋  

🌱 I’m learning software development and GitHub.  
💻 I recently made my first open-source contribution, where I learned how to fork a repository, make commits, and submit pull requests.  
🎯 My goal is to build small projects using HTML, CSS, and Python, and to keep improving my coding skills.  
✨ Fun fact: I enjoy creating projects that can help others learn and grow.

## My Reflection
I’m learning how to use GitHub through this project.
I now know how to:
- Fork a repository  
- Make edits and commit changes  
- Add my name to the contributors list  
- Create new files and describe my project

This experience helped me understand how open-source contributions work.
